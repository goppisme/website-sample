            <li>1-1.5 tsp red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
            <li>1-1.5 tsp biryani masala</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp turmeric powder</li>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For the Rice:
            <ul>
            <li>1.5 cups basmati rice (aged, rinsed, and soaked for 30 minutes)</li>
            <li>4 tbsp vegetable oil (or ghee)</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves (cilantro)</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped mint leaves</li>
            <li>2 tsp saffron strands (soaked in 3 tbsp hot milk)</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Process</h1>
    <ol>
     <li>Marinate the Chicken: In a large bowl, combine yogurt, red chili powder, biryani masala, turmeric powder, green chilies, ginger-garlic paste, cardamom powder, and salt. Add chicken pieces and mix well to coat them evenly. Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes, preferably overnight for deeper flavors.</li>
     <li>Cook the Rice: In a large pot, bring enough water (around 4 cups) to a boil. Add the soaked basmati rice, salt, and a few drops of oil. Cook according to package instructions or until the rice is 80% cooked but still has a slight bite. Drain the rice and spread it on a plate to cool slightly.</li>
     <li>Assemble the Biryani: Heat oil (or ghee) in a heavy-bottomed pot or pressure cooker. Fry the sliced onions until golden brown. Add the marinated chicken pieces and cook over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
     <li>Layering: In the pot with cooked chicken and onions, spread half of the cooked rice. Sprinkle with half of the chopped coriander leaves, mint leaves, and a few drops of saffron milk. Repeat the layer with remaining rice, herbs, and saffron milk.</li>
     <li>Cooking (Pot Method): Cover the pot tightly with a lid and seal with foil if using a regular pot. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and flavors are absorbed.</li>
     <li>Cooking (Pressure Cooker Method): Close the pressure cooker lid and cook for 3-4 whistles on medium heat. Let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes before opening the lid.</li>
     <li>Garnish and Serve: Once cooked, gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Garnish with additional chopped coriander leaves and fried onions (optional). Serve hot with raita or your favorite chutney.</li>
    </ol>
