    <h1>Thalassery Biryani recipe</h1>
    <p>Thalassery biryani, a fragrant rice dish, hails from Kerala, India. It features black pepper, cloves, cardamom, and coconut milk for a unique taste. Unlike many biryanis, it leans towards lighter spices. Mint and coriander leaves add a refreshing touch, while raisins and cashews offer contrasting textures. Traditionally cooked with chicken, it's a delightful and flavorful biryani experience.</p>

        </li>
        <li>For the Rice:
            <ul>
                <li>1.5 cups basmati rice, soaked for 30 minutes</li>
                <li>3 tbsp ghee (or vegetable oil)</li>

                <li>1/4 cup raisins</li>
                <li>1/4 cup cashews</li>

                <li>Salt to taste</li>
                <li>Water (enough to cook rice)</li>
                </ul>
        </li>
        <li>For Garnishing (optional):
           <ul>
            <li>Fried onions</li>
            <li>Chopped coriander leaves</li>
           </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Process</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Marinate the Chicken: Wash and pat dry the chicken pieces. In a large bowl, combine yogurt, red chili powder, coriander powder, turmeric powder, biryani masala (or garam masala), salt, and ginger-garlic paste. Add chicken pieces and mix well to coat them evenly. Cover and marinate for at least 30 minutes, or preferably overnight for deeper flavors.</li>

        <li>Cook the Rice: Rinse the soaked basmati rice until the water runs clear. In a large pot, bring enough water (around 4 cups) to a boil. Add the rinsed rice, salt, and a few drops of oil. Cook according to package instructions or until the rice is 80% cooked but still has a slight bite. Drain the rice and spread it on a plate to cool slightly.</li>
        
        <li>Cook the Chicken Masala: Heat oil in a large pan or pot. Add sliced onions and fry over medium heat until golden brown. Add chopped green chili (if using) and curry leaves. Saute for a minute. Add the marinated chicken pieces along with any leftover marinade. Increase heat slightly and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until chicken is browned on all sides.</li>
        
        <li>Assemble the Biryani: In the same pot with cooked chicken masala, add half of the cooked rice. Sprinkle with half of the raisins and cashews. Add chopped mint and coriander leaves. Repeat the layer with remaining rice, raisins, cashews, and herbs.</li>
        
        <li>Cooking (Pot Method): Pour enough water (around 1/2 cup) to just moisten the rice. Cover the pot tightly with a lid and seal with foil if using a regular pot. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the rice is fully cooked and flavors are absorbed.</li>
        
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Once cooked, gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Take care not to break the rice. Garnish with fried onions (optional) and chopped coriander leaves. Serve hot with raita or your favorite chutney.</li>

    </ol>
    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Adjust the amount of red chili powder according to your spice preference.</li>
        <li>For a richer flavor, use ghee instead of vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>You can substitute store-bought biryani masala with a mixture of ground coriander, cumin, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Marinating the chicken for a longer duration enhances the flavors.</li>
    </ul>
